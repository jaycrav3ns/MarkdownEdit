# MarkdownEdit
An HTML/JS based Markdown editor.  Wacko Wiki formatting.

Check out the [Demo](https://modulate.66ghz.com/mdedit/).

I put the wiki format into constants. This will make it easy to customize the markdown to any format.

This is fully working.  I'm adding another row of editor buttons, as I've been using it, but for the most part it's ready to go. I've found it very useful (especially having my editor on it's own browser tab).

Enjoy!
